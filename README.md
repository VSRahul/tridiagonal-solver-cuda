Tridiagonal-solver-cuda
=======================

A scalable, numerically stable tridiagonal solver implemented using NVidia CUDA.

This program is based on the IEEE paper:

*A scalable, numerically stable, high-performance tridiagonal solver using GPUs*, by Li-Wen Chang, John A. Stratton, Hee-Seok Kim, and Wen-Mei W. Hwu.

The program here is a well-commented, modified version of the solver developed by the IMPACT Research Group, at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. It can be found [here](http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/Solver.aspx).

For a brief understanding of diagonal pivoting method used in this paper, go through this [file] (http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/rmarcia/pub/slides/SIAM_ALA09_RMarciaweb.pdf).
